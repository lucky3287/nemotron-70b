    "what is pc": "\"PC\" stands for \"personal computer.\" It's a general term for a computer designed for individual use, typically at home or in an office. PCs are characterized by their versatility, handling various tasks like browsing the internet, playing games, creating documents, and managing finances. They are typically built around a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and input/output devices like a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.",
    "what is a computer": "A computer is an electronic device that processes and manipulates data according to instructions. It comprises hardware (physical components) and software (programs that control the hardware).  Computers can perform various tasks, including calculations, data storage, communication, and entertainment. They use binary code (0s and 1s) to represent data and instructions. Modern computers are incredibly versatile and have revolutionized many aspects of our lives.",
    "what is a floating point number": "A floating-point number is a way to represent real numbers (including decimals) in a computer. Unlike integers, which have fixed precision, floating-point numbers use a scientific notation-like system with a mantissa (significant digits) and an exponent. This allows for a wide range of numbers, both very small and very large, but introduces limitations in precision and potential for rounding errors. They are widely used in scientific calculations, graphics, and other applications requiring decimal values.",

Modi's leadership has been praised by some for his development initiatives and strong stance, while others criticize his handling of social issues and alleged human rights violations.",
    "what is mean by computer ar": "\"Computer AR\" likely refers to **Augmented Reality (AR) on a computer**. This technology overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing our perception. It uses cameras, sensors, and software to display virtual objects, data, or interactive elements within your computer's view. This can be experienced through web browsers, dedicated applications, or even through special headsets. \n\nExamples include virtual try-on tools in online shops, interactive 3D models for design and engineering, and educational apps that bring historical landmarks to life.",
    "what is cyber physical systems and security": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are tightly integrated systems that combine computational elements with physical processes. They involve real-time data exchange, feedback loops, and control algorithms to monitor and manipulate physical environments. Examples include smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\n\nCybersecurity for CPS is critical due to the potential for physical harm from cyberattacks. It involves securing the computational components, communication channels, and physical interfaces to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation, or disruption. Key challenges include ensuring data integrity, resilience to attacks, and safeguarding user privacy.",
    "what are the measures to prevent fever": "Preventing fever involves a multi-pronged approach:\n\n**Hygiene:** Wash hands frequently, practice good respiratory hygiene, and avoid close contact with sick individuals.\n\n**Vaccination:** Ensure up-to-date vaccinations, including flu shots, to reduce risk of infections.\n\n**Lifestyle:** Maintain a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and regular exercise to strengthen the immune system.\n\n**Environmental:** Control temperature and humidity, avoid exposure to extreme weather conditions, and ensure proper ventilation in enclosed spaces. \n\n**Prompt Treatment:** Seek medical attention promptly if you develop symptoms, as early treatment can prevent fever from worsening.",
    "what is artificial intelligence": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It encompasses tasks like learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
